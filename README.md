# Optimizing Water Quality through Supervised Machine Learning

### üìù **Project Summary**
Ensuring water quality is critical for protecting **public health** and **environmental sustainability**. This project evaluates the effectiveness of **Supervised Machine Learning** models in predicting the **Water Quality Index (WQI)** and classifying **Water Quality** into five categories. The study employs advanced regression and classification models to offer a reliable and efficient approach for **environmental monitoring**.

### üîç **Problem Statement**
Traditional water quality assessment methods are often resource-intensive and slow, lacking the precision needed for real-time monitoring. This project seeks to improve the **accuracy** and **efficiency** of water quality predictions by using **Machine Learning** models to automate both **WQI prediction** and **Water Quality Classification (WQC)**.

### üìä **Dataset**
The dataset used for this study is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing 3,276 samples with 10 major water quality parameters:
- **pH**
- **Hardness**
- **Solids**
- **Chloramines**
- **Sulfate**
- **Conductivity**
- **Organic Carbon**
- **Trihalomethanes**
- **Turbidity**

### üöÄ **Project Approach**

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Imputation**: Handled missing values using **kNN imputation** from Scikit-learn, which substitutes missing data based on similar nearby observations.
- **Normalization & Standardization**: Applied **Standard Scaler** to standardize features by subtracting the mean and scaling to unit variance, ensuring models perform optimally.

#### 2. Models Used
- **Regression Models** (for WQI Prediction):
  - Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - Decision Tree Regressor (DTR)
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  
- **Classification Models** (for WQC):
  - Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
  - Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### üîë **Key Findings**

#### WQI Prediction (Regression Models)
- The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the highest accuracy with an **R¬≤ score of 0.996**, outperforming all other models.
- **Decision Tree Regressor** and **GBR** also showed strong predictive power with **R¬≤ scores above 0.98**.
  
#### WQC (Classification Models)
- The **Decision Tree Classifier** led with an accuracy of **96.34%**, closely followed by **GBR (96.04%)** and **Random Forest (94.82%)**.
- The models demonstrated high **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Scores**, making them effective for classifying water quality across multiple categories (Excellent, Good, Poor, Very Poor, Unsafe).
